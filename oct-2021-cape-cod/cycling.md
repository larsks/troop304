title: Some notes on the ride
---

## Am I able to ride 30 miles?

Probably! If you're even moderately fit (and as long as your bike is
in good condition and of an appropriate size), 15 miles isn't going to
be much of a challenge, especially on a rail trail (which, because it
runs along an old railroad bed, is very, very flat). Your legs might
feel a bit tired on the way back, but you'll make it!  We'll be taking
it easy while riding, and we'll be taking a long break for lunch.

## Do I need any special clothing?

Not really. For the length of ride we're doing, regular clothing will
probably be just fine. However, if you already own some sort of
bicycle shorts, you may want to wear them. Bicycle-specific clothing
is designed to help keep you comfortable by providing:

- Padding 
- Moisture wicking: moving sweat away from your body
- Strategically placed seams to prevent chafing

When people think of bicycle clothing, they often think of tight,
form-fitting Lycra shorts. While these are fine, they're not the only
option. It's easy to find more traditional looking shorts that are
hiding bicycle shorts on the inside.

## What you'll need to bring on the ride

For our longer ride, you will want to bring the following (which will
hopefully sound a lot like the things you would typically bring on a
hike):

- Water
- A snack (no nuts!)
- A lunch
- A route map

The snack will be important if you feel your energy flagging before or
after lunch.

You will also want a place to stow some warm clothing. You may want to
wear a sweater or something when we start up, but depending on the
weather and our level of exertion you may want to take it off during
the ride. If the weather is cool, you will definitely want something
warm when we stop for a break or for lunch to prevent yourself from
cooling off too quickly. As with hiking, dressing in layers is a good
idea, because that gives you some flexibility in responding to changes
in temperature and activity.

## Navigating

Bicycle tours would traditionally provide you with a "cue sheet",
which is a list of directions, like these directions to get from the
United Methodist Church to Belmont High School:

| # | Go | onto Road/Street | Miles | Total |
|---|----|------------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | L  | Common St        | 1     | 1     |
| 2 | R  | Concord Ave      | 0.5   | 1.5   |

Using a cue sheet requires you to have some way of measuring distance,
such as a [bicycle computer][], but these have largely been replaced
by modern smartphones and tools like Google Maps.

## Rules of the road

While our ride is mostly on the rail trail, there will be parts of it
on the main roads. Whether on or off the trail, when cycling as a
group we should follow these rules:

- Wear a helmet
- Bicycle single file
- Obey all traffic laws
- [Signal our turns][]
