  load patrol boxes, tents, water jugs, and other equipment into cars.
  You should eat before hand, or plan to acquire food on the road.

  We are staying at [Camp Greenough][] in Yarmouth, MA, at the
  "Scoutcraft" campsite. You can see a [complete map of the
  reservation](maps/Camp_Map_BW.pdf), or a [map of the central

  of the Scoutcraft site.

### Saturday, October 16

We are planning two bike rides for Saturday:

- The Long Option (32 miles): Leave around 10AM with a packed lunch,
  bike about 16 miles along the rail trail to [Crosby Beach][] at
  Nickerson State Park. Eat lunch and explore the flats at the beach.
  Return to Camp Greenough in mid-afternoon with ample time to get
  dinner going.

- The Short Option (16 miles): Leave at 10AM, bike about an hour along
  the rail trail to the [Harwich Bicycle Rotary][] (about 8 miles),
  and then return to Camp Greenough in time for lunch. Afternoon
  activities at camp TBD.
