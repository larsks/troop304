title: Carrying things on your bike
---

You can obviously just toss everything in a backpack and be done with
it, but there are some disadvantages to a backpack:

- You probably won't be able to reach your water while you're cycling.
  You will need to stop, remove your backpack, take a drink, and then
  put everything back.

- A backpack will often leave you with a sweaty back, which can be
  very uncomfortable in cooler weather (especially when you stop for a
  break).

- The weight of a backpack can be uncomfortable over time.

Generally, it's better to let your bike carry things for you if you
have that option.

For water in particular, bottle cages mounted to the frame of your
bicycle are convenient because they allow you to retrieve a water
bottle while cycling. While many cages are designed to attach to
special mounting holes on your bicycle, you can also find ones that
simply clip or strap on to your bike.

For everything else, the best option is probably a [bike rack][] and
[panniers][]. This keeps the weight on your bike and off your back,
and gives you a lower center of gravity which makes it easier to
control your bicycle. Bike racks and panniers are available from your
local bike shop (who will happily install them for you) and online (if
you're comfortable doing it yourself).

[Grocery bag panniers][] are inexpensive, easy to use and are designed
to hold a shopping bag, which makes them great for trips to the
grocery store. Typically they are open on top, which makes them less
effective in inclement weather (and means that things can bounce out
if they are light enough).

There a variety of other styles of pannier: totally waterproof ones
for protecting you gear in rainy weather; panniers designed
specifically for commuting to work and school that will carry a laptop
and other gear; panniers designed for long-distance bicycle touring,
etc. As with any sort of bag, prices for panniers very greatly, and
you will probably able to find something to match your budget with a
little bit of research.  You can even [make your own panniers][] if
you are so inclined.

For just carrying lunch and snack, another option is a [handlebar
bag][]. These are generally cheaper than panniers, but they are
limited in how much weight they can carry: you don't want to put too
much weight on your handlebars because it can significantly impact the
handling of your bicycle.
